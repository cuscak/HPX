+---TIPS 
    - PDF -> Preferences -> Page Display: swith on/off local fonts (pdf will use embeded fonts, if no embeded then substituted fonts)    
      + embeded font adds aprox. 20kb to file size
      + when need to embed: Type 1 fonts over TrueType fonts (embedded Type 1 fonts are much smaller)
    - use bookmarklets!

+---TOOLS
    - work with postscript as with PDF ---> GSview (ghostscript set of tools)
    - work with XSL-FO files, http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/download.html

+---KNOWLEDGE
    - Font subsetting is the technique of embedding only a portion of a font
      (font subset contains only the characters used in your document).
    - javascirp in Acrobate (add new funcionality to PDFs)!
      [When Acrobat starts up, it runs any JavaScripts it finds in either the system-level JavaScripts folder or the user-level JavaScripts folder]
    - URL structure <scheme>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<path>;<params>?<query>#<frag>
